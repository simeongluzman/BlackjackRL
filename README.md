test1.ipynb contains the initial test for interacting with the blackjack env in the gym library, just so we understand how the environment works b4 we move on to making the logic for the agent. 

To test it, install the libraries in the requirements.txt file and try running the box below. If you have issues  w installation (i had a few), just ask chatgpt and it will help. i needed to install a lib called swig. 


##  TODO
MAIN: CREATE TEST_POLICY METHOD TO CHECK WIN RATE USING THE POLICY OUTPUT

1. Check if your logic for terminal state checks is right
2. Tweak parameters, see how policy changes
3. Attempt hard coding always hit if less than 12
4. Add double feature to environment (if results get better for hit/stay variant)
5. Implement running count as part of observation
6. HISTOGRAM/POLICY VISUALIZATION
